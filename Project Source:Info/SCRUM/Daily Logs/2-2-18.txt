Since the website was not working for the Friday morning meeting with the Client, the whole team worked on figuring out what was not working with AWS. We ended up having to recreate the database on a different account with AWS. We were able to link our front end an back end with a simple button to dump the database. Created a domain name for the website: open-fridge.com. Sent the link to the Client.
